# ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Book

Based on the Web Application built in the Book 'ASP.NET Core Razor Pages in Action' by Mike Brind (Manning, 2022).

City Breaks is a web application for booking short holidays. It covers the topics of using forms and working with data,
securing your application and ensuring that it performs well before publishing it.
